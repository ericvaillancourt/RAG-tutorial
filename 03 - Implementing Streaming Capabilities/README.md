# Mastering LangChain RAG: Implementing Streaming Capabilities (Part 3)

Welcome to the third part of our in-depth series on LangChain's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. This repository contains the code examples and explanations for implementing streaming capabilities in a RAG-based application. By following this tutorial, you will learn how to handle real-time data processing with RAG, perfect for applications requiring immediate responses.

## Overview

In this tutorial, we focus on implementing streaming with RAG to handle real-time data processing efficiently. This is particularly useful for applications requiring immediate responses. Additionally, we cover how to integrate sources with the responses to add transparency and credibility to the generated outputs.

## Introduction

In many Q&A applications, providing real-time answers while maintaining source transparency is crucial for establishing trust and credibility. This tutorial explores practical approaches for integrating streaming capabilities and source transparency into your applications.

2. **[Integrating Chat History](https://medium.com/@eric_vaillancourt/mastering-langchain-rag-integrating-chat-history-part-2-4c80eae11b43)**: Incorporate chat history into your RAG model.
3. **[Implementing Streaming Capabilities](https://medium.com/@eric_vaillancourt/mastering-langchain-rag-implementing-streaming-capabilities-part-3-e3f4885ea66a)**: Handle real-time data processing with RAG.
4. **Returning Sources with Results**: Configure RAG to provide sources along with responses.
5. **Adding Citations to Your Results**: Include citations in your results for verifiability.
6. **Putting It All Together**: Build a comprehensive RAG application integrating all components.


## Getting Started

All code examples mentioned in this tutorial can be found in the `03 - Implementing Streaming Capabilities` folder. To get started, clone this repository and navigate to the relevant folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericvaillancourt/RAG-tutorial.git
cd RAG-tutorial/03 - Implementing Streaming Capabilities
```

## Environment Setup

Ensure your development environment is prepared with the necessary dependencies. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain langchain-community langchainhub langchain-openai langchain-chroma bs4 python-dotenv sqlalchemy fastapi
```

You also need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable for the embeddings model. This can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file. Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Load the environment variable in your code:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

## Code Explanation

### Importing Libraries and Modules

We start by importing necessary libraries and modules, including `BeautifulSoup`, `langchain`, and `FastAPI`.

### Loading and Processing Documents

We load and process documents from the web using `WebBaseLoader` and `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, then create embeddings using `OpenAIEmbeddings`.

### Setting Up the Retriever and LLM

We set up a retriever to fetch relevant documents and configure the language model (LLM) for generating responses.

### Implementing the Q&A Chain

We implement the Q&A chain using `RunnableParallel` and `RunnablePassthrough` to handle the context and question processing.

### Streaming Data with FastAPI

We set up a FastAPI application to stream data to the client using Server-Sent Events (SSE), enabling real-time updates.

### Creating the HTML Frontend

We create an HTML frontend that connects to the FastAPI streaming endpoint and displays the streamed data in real-time.

## Usage

Run the FastAPI server to start streaming data:

```bash
python main.py
```

Access the frontend by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` and submit your questions to see real-time streamed responses.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to implement streaming capabilities in a RAG-based application using FastAPI and SSE. This approach enhances user experience by providing real-time updates and maintaining source transparency.
