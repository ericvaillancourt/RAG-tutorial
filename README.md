# Mastering LangChain RAG

Welcome to the **Mastering LangChain RAG** series repository. This repository contains all the code examples and resources for the six-part series on LangChain's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.

## Overview

This series aims to equip developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts with the knowledge to implement and optimize RAG in their projects. Each part of the series builds on the previous one, gradually introducing more advanced concepts and techniques.

## Series Outline

1. **[Quick Start Guide to LangChain RAG](https://medium.com/@eric_vaillancourt/mastering-langchain-rag-a-comprehensive-tutorial-series-part-1-28faf6257fea)**: Basics of setting up LangChain RAG.
2. **[Integrating Chat History](https://medium.com/@eric_vaillancourt/mastering-langchain-rag-integrating-chat-history-part-2-4c80eae11b43)**: Incorporate chat history into your RAG model.
3. **[Implementing Streaming Capabilities](https://medium.com/@eric_vaillancourt/mastering-langchain-rag-implementing-streaming-capabilities-part-3-e3f4885ea66a)**: Handle real-time data processing with RAG.
4. **Returning Sources with Results**: Configure RAG to provide sources along with responses.
5. **Adding Citations to Your Results**: Include citations in your results for verifiability.
6. **Putting It All Together**: Build a comprehensive RAG application integrating all components.

## Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to a part of the series and contains relevant code examples and resources:

- `01 - Quickstart`: Code for the quick start guide to LangChain RAG.
- `02 - Integrating Chat History`: Code for integrating chat history into your RAG model.
- `03 - Implementing Streaming Capabilities`: Code for implementing streaming capabilities with RAG.
